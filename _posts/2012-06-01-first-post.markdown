After months of hesitation (due to both work and personal issues), I finally went ahead and created this modest web site. It was the perfect excuse to have a crack at WordPress, since the goal was to roll out its first version in the smallest possible time frame. It'll surely go through some changes in the near future (structure, content and presentation wise) as I explore what WordPress has to offer and come to terms with the kind of content I want to share.

Live long and prosper!
