    <h3>First post!</h3>
    <article>
        <p>After months of hesitation (due to both work and personal issues), I finally went ahead and created this modest web site. It was the perfect excuse to have a crack at WordPress, since the goal was to roll out its first version in the smallest possible time frame. It&rsquo;ll surely go through some changes in the near future (structure, content and presentation wise) as I explore what WordPress has to offer and come to terms with the kind of content I want to share.</p>
<p>Live long and prosper!</p>
