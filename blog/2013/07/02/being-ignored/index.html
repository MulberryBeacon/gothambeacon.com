    <h2>Being Ignored</h2>

        <p>I hate being ignored. It&rsquo;s one of my (many) pet peeves. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s precisely the kind of antics seen in many technical recruiters.</p>
<p>Last month I was ignored by two recruiters through LinkedIn. I sent a couple of InMails apologizing for the approach and asking if they could spare a couple of minutes to answer some quick questions regarding their como anise. The only reply I got was silence. Pure and simple. Straight up. Shaken, not stirred.</p>
<p>For a while, I wondered if I had done something wrong or written something that might have put them off. Or maybe it was my profile that didn&rsquo;t click. Not the right skill set? Not enough skills in my bag of magic tricks? I even left the door wide open for them to brush me aside with a quick &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not interested&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As much as I&rsquo;ve tried to understand, I just can&rsquo;t. There isn&rsquo;t a plausible explanation for this lack of response. I find it snobbish and a bit demeaning. I wonder how they would feel if I neglected to reply to one of their approaches. Surely no one could say &ldquo;not interested&rdquo; to their companies, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you work for one of the best companies in the world and have to go through thousands of applications. If you think I&rsquo;m not a fit for your company (or simply not good enough), take a minute to send a quick e-mail saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not interested right now. Maybe some other time. Sorry.&rdquo; No hard feelings. I know the drill.</p>
<p>Just remember that I invested a lot of personal time preparing and submitting my application. The least you could do is say &lsquo;no&rsquo;. Also take into account that the way you treat me reflects heavily on the company you represent. A poor attitude might lead me (and others) to think that maybe it isn&rsquo;t such a great company to work for after all. That&rsquo;s one way of letting top talent slip through your fingers.</p>
