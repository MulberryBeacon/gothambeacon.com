    <h2>The Front End Developer Cometh</h2>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve reinvented myself a few times throughout my career and it&rsquo;s that time again. Over the next four months, I&rsquo;ll be working as a full-time front end developer. My last hardcore project involving <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> was 5 years ago when I wrote around 2000 lines of vanilla JavaScript and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> at an insurance company. To be honest with myself, I wrote that code without actually knowing how to code in JavaScript. It was something that needed to be done and I got it done, as simple as that. As the years passed, the only occasions where I dabbled with front end technologies were when I needed to do minor work on my blog.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve been keeping tabs on the state of the art in front end technologies, my hands-on experience is extremely limited. Recently at work, we had a front end project delivered by a contractor that was sub par, to say the least. It was an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> app that was fundamentally broken and I had to step in and fix it as best I could in a very short period of time in order to meet project deadlines. In the process, I got slightly acquainted with AngularJS, but just enough to fix the plumbing in the project. I&rsquo;m now diving into different frameworks and tools (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, etc.) to implement a fully fledged web application. Above all, I&rsquo;ll try to make the most of the opportunity and learn proper JavaScript and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, just like my last project allowed me to significantly deepen my knowledge of <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
