        <p>I was planning on writing a long essay to review my personal experiences throughout 2020. Yet, it was too much to unpack and analyze in the end. As such, I&rsquo;ll be publishing a series of small write-ups on topics that were a mainstay during this past year. In them, I&rsquo;ll go through how they affected me, and also do a bit of digging into the past. To me, 2020 presented itself as a weirdly fitting scenario to reflect on past experiences, and dissect how they changed my way of observing and interacting with the world.</p>
<h2 id="past-experiences">Past experiences</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s topic is work. I&rsquo;m no stranger to working from home, and I quite prefer it to the standard office routine. I have a solid routine, and I&rsquo;m much more productive at home than I could ever be at an office. It doesn&rsquo;t help that commuting in London is a mess. If you&rsquo;re not at a walking distance of your workplace, any commute is going to be a hot, crowded, and stressful mess.</p>
<p>Over the past nine years, I&rsquo;ve worked for four different companies. Two of them allowed me to work from home (usually for three days per week), but the other two imposed restrictions. One of these didn&rsquo;t provide any work from home scheme. They stood by their belief that true work and collaboration only happens at the office. It&rsquo;s always nice to interact with other people in person, even if it&rsquo;s only to have a cup of coffee and throw in some banter. But the illusion of collaboration only happening at the office is just that: an illusion. If people spend the majority of the day avoiding human contact, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re sitting in the same physical space. With the ongoing lockdowns, I hope the memo got through. Working from home doesn&rsquo;t prevent collaboration, creativity, or work from happening. I also hope everyone over there is doing well, even those that were unprofessional enough to lead me to seek greener pastures.</p>
<p>There was one other company where I split my daily hours 50/50 between the office and home. That turned out to be a terrible experience for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the people at the company were blatantly incompetent and unprofessional</li>
<li>Unlike what these people thought, the company wasn&rsquo;t prepared to deal with remote employees</li>
<li>The commute was quite bad, both in logistics and duration. It was hard to synchronize the schedules of different public transports when the time tables kept changing (courtesy of TfL)</li>
<li>The added pressure of doing the school runs, and synchronizing them with the commute, was exhausting</li>
<li>This had a measurable impact on my productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make matters worse, I found myself doing work that I didn&rsquo;t want to do. It&rsquo;s no wonder that my tenure only lasted for three months. It was one of the most valuable learning experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had (for the worst possible reasons).</p>
<h2 id="company">Company</h2>
<p>At my current company, we agreed from the start that I would only commute to the office once or twice per week. This changed when the UK government finally acknowledged that the pandemic was real and sweeping through the islands<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. At that point, everyone moved to a full remote scheme.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was a hard year for the company. When the first lockdown started in the UK, we agreed to reduce our work hours and take a pay cut for six months to help keep the lights on. We closed our office and I took in a massive inventory of older hardware that we wanted to salvage. Over the following months, I split the majority of it between work colleagues. The last batch went to our data scientist for work purposes. That was a massive relief, as I was able to reclaim quite a bit of storage around the house. Also, having less hardware at hand makes me less prone to dabble with ideas of having servers to run &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. Alas, I still have two functional CPU + motherboard bundles and I&rsquo;ll eventually get rid of one of them. It&rsquo;s useful to have a spare working computer around (trust me, I&rsquo;ve used it a few times already for very specific purposes).</p>
<p>In the end, we all went over and beyond the line of duty by putting in more hours than we should&rsquo;ve. There was a strong commitment to save the company and our jobs. In late September, the company was acquired, making it a bittersweet conclusion to the whole situation. Some people were let go, but the company bounced back and we&rsquo;re stable at this point. The main changes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>I stepped into the role of acting CTO (my official title is &ldquo;head of development&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Took on increased responsibilities in dealing with clients, managing projects, and dealing with other administrative/corporate tasks</li>
<li>Remained as the only full-time developer</li>
<li>Added the DevOps work to my already extensive stack of roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>In January, we re-hired an ex-employee and that was an amazing boost on the development front. But it hasn&rsquo;t all been smooth sailing. There are some ongoing issues that I&rsquo;ll touch upon in a later opportunity.</p>

<p>Yes, I said &ldquo;islands&rdquo;. Unlike most politicians around here, I never forget about Northern Ireland. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
