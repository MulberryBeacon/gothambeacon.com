        <p>After many years without a desktop computer, I decided to build one in late 2018 to use as my main computer. My Surface Pro 3 was ageing fast and couldn&rsquo;t keep up with my increasing demands. After a price comparison frenzy, I ended up with a <a href="https://gothambeacon/blog/2019/01/02/the-home-office-hardware-edition/">solid computer</a>. After around seven months of keeping a close eye on the computer, there we two aspects of it that annoyed me. I wasn&rsquo;t very happy with the Spire cooler that came bundled with the Ryzen 5 2600X. The noise level was annoying, no matter what fan profile I tried to configure in the motherboard UEFI. Also, I faced too many occasions where I exhausted the 16 GB of RAM I had at the time while working.</p>
<p>I decided to go for a little upgrade in mid-2019, influenced by the decrease in price of RAM. I got a <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nh-d15">Noctua NH-D15</a> for the CPU and a kit of <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Memory/VENGEANCE%C2%AE-LPX-32GB-%282-x-16GB%29-DDR4-DRAM-3000MHz-C15-Memory-Kit-%E2%80%93-White/p/CMK32GX4M2B3000C15W">Corsair LPX Vengeance 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) 3000 MHz C15</a>. I ended up with a total of 48 GB of RAM (2 x 8 GB and 2 x 16 GB) and a zebra colour scheme. It brings a <em>je ne sais quoi</em> to the design (no, it doesn&rsquo;t). The cooler had an immediate impact on the system with a 10C decrease to the average CPU temperature. As for the RAM, Vivaldi and Firefox have tried (and failed) to conquer it.</p>
<p>Late last year, I started contemplating my flawed approach to data management. The first step to start organizing all the information I have in my hard drives was to buy more drives, of course. If you have a problem, you throw money and hardware at it. Right, you throw money at retailers to buy hardware that you&rsquo;ll then throw at the problem. In early 2020, I took the jump and pulled the trigger on a <a href="https://www.seagate.com/gb/en/internal-hard-drives/hdd/ironwolf/">12 TB Seagate Ironwolf drive</a>. That allowed me to copy all the data I have to it and start the cleansing. I was also able to cancel the cloud storage subscription I was using (Microsoft OneDrive). The data organization part is still ongoing and I&rsquo;ll need two more hard drives to wrap up everything. Alas, times are tough, so tight budgeting rules are in place.</p>
