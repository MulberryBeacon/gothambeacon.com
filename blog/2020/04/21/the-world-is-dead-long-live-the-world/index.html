    <h3>The World is Dead. Long Live the World.</h3>
    <article>
        <p>Almost a year has passed since I last wrote anything on this blog. So much has happened that I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin. As a wise human once said, maybe it&rsquo;s best if I just start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Around this time last year, I was starting to have second thoughts about the company I was working at. The true nature of some people in the team had become all too clear and I wondered if I&rsquo;d made (yet) another blunder in choosing a place to work at. It&rsquo;s a clear pattern throughout my career that seems mostly based on the amount of pressure I&rsquo;m under when accepting job offers. Anyway, fast forward to August and it was clear I&rsquo;d run my course there, so I resigned and left at the end of September. I spent a month resting and preparing for another interview cycle when I was given the chance to rejoin the first company I worked at when I initially moved to London.</p>
<p>Things got slightly on track and plans were made for the upcoming year. Alas, the COVID-19 pandemic swept through the world and turned it upside down. On a personal level, the initial impact was having a fairly apprehensive kid at home with school closures in place and the added stress of my wife being a key worker in the NHS. Then came the lockdown in the UK and all the economic turmoil that followed. The timing couldn&rsquo;t have been worse for my company and, like many others, immediate cost-cutting measures were put in place to guarantee the sustainability of the business, including reduced work hours and salaries. Plans made, plans put on hold.</p>
<p>Unlike so many people out there, I&rsquo;m still fortunate to have a job. I&rsquo;m working hard (maybe harder than ever) to do my part and make sure that everyone at the company has a job to come back to for the foreseeable future. But this brings a lot of financial uncertainty that piles up pressure on an already stressful situation, for many personal reasons that I won&rsquo;t disclose. Some days are easier, others not so much. Good spirits (or the semblance of them, at least) are required to make my kid feel as comfortable and happy as possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be dumping some of my thoughts here as I feel the need to. Just like managing a hard drive and clearing up space for new batches of data. From a non-mechanical perspective, to vent and clear my mind as much as I can.</p>
