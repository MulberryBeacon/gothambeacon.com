        <p>While trying to publish my last post, I realized that my blog was completely broken. It had been a year since I used <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and I downloaded its latest version to build the blog. Alas, my templates were &ldquo;outdated&rdquo; and could no longer be used to generate static pages. I wanted to change quite a few things in the layout, so I took this as a positive reinforcement (Pavlovian pun intended).</p>
<p>It was a struggle to get it up and running, though. Confusion best describes my first 10-minute impression of the Hugo documentation. There aren&rsquo;t enough examples of the API to explain some of its methods. A few tutorials on YouTube did the trick for me and I understood the changes I needed to make in my templates.</p>
<p>I realized that diving straight back into the documentation was a mistake. I should&rsquo;ve started with the basics and build my way up to the constructs I needed to fix my templates. Mind you, the documentation still seems geared towards more advanced users. Previous experience with other static website frameworks and a generous level of tech-savviness seems like a hefty price of entry.</p>
<p>Anyway, the blog is now working and the deployment process is simple enough. This removes any excuse for not writing.</p>
