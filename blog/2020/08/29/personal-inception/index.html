        <p>I spent two weeks on annual leave after an eight-month stretch of intense work, lockdown, parenting, homeschooling, and madness in the world. Being away from my usual surroundings, I spent some time going through what&rsquo;s been happening in my life and made some decisions to maintain my sanity. A sort of early New Year&rsquo;s resolutions that I actually intend to keep.</p>
<p>This sort of internal introspection audit led to some conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I forgot how to relax and have fun. These two weeks were a perfect example of it. My brain kept drifting towards work and personal concerns. I interpret this as making me feel guilty for trying to have fun</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t been watching movies and shows with the same passion and frequency as before</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t been reading. At all. I used to love reading</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t been gaming. At all. I used to love gaming</li>
<li>I stopped exercising altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s a worrying trend that&rsquo;s been dragging on for quite a while now. If I were to make an educated guess on when it started, I&rsquo;d trace it back to about three years ago.</p>
<p>One of the main symptoms is an inability to focus on a single task for more than a few minutes. This has taken its toll at work as well. Lately, it&rsquo;s been quite a struggle to focus on anything that&rsquo;ll take me more than a few hours to address. If the task at hand involves looking up possible solutions and understanding complex concepts, it&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the improvements I need to make are clear and easy to plan (in theory):</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut back on my work hours. Even with shorter work days due to the COVID pandemic, I&rsquo;ve been keeping up with my old work schedule and it absorbs any personal time I have</li>
<li>Get back into reading. As I work on my focus issue, I&rsquo;m starting with small books from my kid&rsquo;s library. As I pick up the pace, I&rsquo;ll move to the kind of books I want to read (sci-fi, history, politics, etc.)</li>
<li>Get my mojo back for movies. I used to love cinema, but it got diluted into every day&rsquo;s concerns</li>
<li>Find time to play games. I&rsquo;ve already gone back to &ldquo;Batman: Arkham Asylum&rdquo; to finish the game in the hard difficulty level. I&rsquo;m hoping that beating up some juiced-up Joker thugs will help release some stress</li>
<li>Go on a strict diet and ramp up my physical activity to the point that it becomes a daily routine. I&rsquo;m not getting any younger, so looking after myself and carefully choosing what I eat is more important than ever.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m dead serious when I say that these are not going to turn into the run of the mill New Year&rsquo;s resolutions. I&rsquo;m committing to this.</p>
