I hope Microsoft comes out with this sooner rather than later. I haven't looked back since I signed up for Game Pass and the possibility of having an all-encompassing package with Live Gold and Game Pass both for the Xbox and PC is too good to turn down. I prefer to play racing, fighting and sports games on the Xbox, but first-person shooters (and the occasional dabbling with RTS's) are a keyboard and mouse affair for me.
