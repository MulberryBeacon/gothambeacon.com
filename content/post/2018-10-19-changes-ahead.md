My blog is straightforward. Technically speaking, I use the minimum amount of CSS (70 bytes minified) and JavaScript (none, actually) to define a simple layout. I'm currently using [Hugo][hugo] as the underlying framework to generate a static site and [GitHub Pages][githubpages] for hosting.

I'm getting to a point where I want to take my blog to the next level. I've been increasingly interested in problem-solving and want to create a specific section to focus on programming challenges. I also want to start a new personal challenge of trying out different technologies and writing a brief description of the overall experience and how to take the first steps. I would also publish on [GitHub][github] any code resulting from these experiences.

But this will involve a significant amount of changes in the current layout of the blog. At this point, I'm wondering if I should keep going with Hugo or take the opportunity and move to another framework. [Gatsby][gatsby] has been under my radar for quite some time now and brings several cool things to the table:

* Could be the perfect excuse to dig into [React][react] finally
* It would give me more flexibility regarding defining templates for specific sections of the blog
* These templates would be used for any site I build in the future, keeping the same look and feel in everything I create
* The performance metrics on sites created with Gatsby are very impressive.

Here are some of the changes I want to push forward:

* New logo (yes, I'll unleashing the hidden designer in me)
* Create sections for different topics to better organize the current single list of posts
* Add labels to add a more fine-grained high-level description of the content on posts
* Add a treemap to display posts by year
* Add the publish date to each post and the list of updates with the corresponding dates
* Integrate my [introduction page][mulberrybeacon] into the blog as a sort of "About Me" page.

The next steps will be:

* Slowly change the current template to increasingly match what I envision to be the future layout for the blog
* Create a small prototype with Gatsby to better grasp the learning curve in both bootstrapping a new website with this framework and porting the current layout to React.

Oh, and keep writing!
