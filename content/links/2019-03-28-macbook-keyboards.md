They're one of the worst Apple "innovations" I've seen since I'm a Mac user. Its origin stems from the unwavering obsession with thinness that follows the mantra "form over function" to the letter. [Joanna Stern wrote a brilliant column for The Wall Street Journal][wsj] debunking this keyboard for the technological fraud it is.

In response, an Apple spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal the following:

> "We are aware that a small number of users are having issues with their third-generation butterfly keyboard and for that we are sorry. The vast majority of Mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the new keyboard."

This is a textbook sorry-not-sorry statement where the only missing piece is saying that the users that have issues with their keyboards are using it wrong.

Sigh, Apple.
