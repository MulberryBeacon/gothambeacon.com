I've reinvented myself a few times throughout my career and it's that time again. Over the next four months, I'll be working as a full-time front end developer. My last hardcore project involving [JavaScript][javascript] was 5 years ago when I wrote around 2000 lines of vanilla JavaScript and [jQuery][jquery] at an insurance company. To be honest with myself, I wrote that code without actually knowing how to code in JavaScript. It was something that needed to be done and I got it done, as simple as that. As the years passed, the only occasions where I dabbled with front end technologies were when I needed to do minor work on my blog. 

Although I've been keeping tabs on the state of the art in front end technologies, my hands-on experience is extremely limited. Recently at work, we had a front end project delivered by a contractor that was sub par, to say the least. It was an [AngularJS][angularjs] app that was fundamentally broken and I had to step in and fix it as best I could in a very short period of time in order to meet project deadlines. In the process, I got slightly acquainted with AngularJS, but just enough to fix the plumbing in the project. I'm now diving into different frameworks and tools ([Node.js][nodejs], [npm][npm], [Angular][angular], [Webpack][webpack], etc.) to implement a fully fledged web application. Above all, I'll try to make the most of the opportunity and learn proper JavaScript and [TypeScript][typescript], just like my last project allowed me to significantly deepen my knowledge of [Python][python].
