            <h3>Fan Fiction. Or Is It?</h3>
            <article>
                <p>I&rsquo;ve always been conflicted about fan fiction. A mix of having so much stuff to read from well known authors and not bothering to look for high quality fan fiction (it&rsquo;s out there if you look long and hard) has led me to ignore it almost completely.</p>

<p>But this is something else. I don&rsquo;t know if calling it fan fiction would be insulting, so I won&rsquo;t. What I&rsquo;ll say is that this short story (yes, I&rsquo;ll call it that) is one of the most brilliant pieces I&rsquo;ve read about Batman that wasn&rsquo;t written by someone on DC&rsquo;s payroll. It doesn&rsquo;t tell a story about Batman, but rather tells Batman&rsquo;s story. A medical report that sums up the physical consequences of being the Dark Knight and how his alter-ego Bruce Wayne goes about with keeping up appearances by playing the part of the unlucky billionaire who keeps getting into trouble.</p>

<p>Hats off to Russell Saunders. I&rsquo;ve read it so many times since stumbling into it back in 2012 and I can&rsquo;t stop admiring its brilliancy every time I read it.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t transcribe it here. <a href="http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/blog/2011/11/14/patient-bw-dob-2161971/">Follow the link</a>. It&rsquo;s only fair.</p>
