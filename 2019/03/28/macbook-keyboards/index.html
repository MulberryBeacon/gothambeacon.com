            <h3>MacBook Keyboards</h3>
            <article>
                <p>They&rsquo;re one of the worst Apple &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve seen since I&rsquo;m a Mac user. Its origin stems from the unwavering obsession with thinness that follows the mantra &ldquo;form over function&rdquo; to the letter. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/apple-still-hasnt-fixed-its-macbook-keyboard-problem/">Joanna Stern wrote a brilliant column for The Wall Street Journal</a> debunking this keyboard for the technological fraud it is.</p>

<p>In response, an Apple spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We are aware that a small number of users are having issues with their third-generation butterfly keyboard and for that we are sorry. The vast majority of Mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the new keyboard.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a textbook sorry-not-sorry statement where the only missing piece is saying that the users that have issues with their keyboards are using it wrong.</p>

<p>Sigh, Apple.</p>
