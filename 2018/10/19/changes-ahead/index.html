            <h3>Changes Ahead</h3>
            <article>
                <p>My blog is straightforward. Technically speaking, I use the minimum amount of CSS (70 bytes minified) and JavaScript (none, actually) to define a simple layout. I&rsquo;m currently using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as the underlying framework to generate a static site and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for hosting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting to a point where I want to take my blog to the next level. I&rsquo;ve been increasingly interested in problem-solving and want to create a specific section to focus on programming challenges. I also want to start a new personal challenge of trying out different technologies and writing a brief description of the overall experience and how to take the first steps. I would also publish on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> any code resulting from these experiences.</p>

<p>But this will involve a significant amount of changes in the current layout of the blog. At this point, I&rsquo;m wondering if I should keep going with Hugo or take the opportunity and move to another framework. <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> has been under my radar for quite some time now and brings several cool things to the table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Could be the perfect excuse to dig into <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> finally</li>
<li>It would give me more flexibility regarding defining templates for specific sections of the blog</li>
<li>These templates would be used for any site I build in the future, keeping the same look and feel in everything I create</li>
<li>The performance metrics on sites created with Gatsby are very impressive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the changes I want to push forward:</p>

<ul>
<li>New logo (yes, I&rsquo;ll unleashing the hidden designer in me)</li>
<li>Create sections for different topics to better organize the current single list of posts</li>
<li>Add labels to add a more fine-grained high-level description of the content on posts</li>
<li>Add a treemap to display posts by year</li>
<li>Add the publish date to each post and the list of updates with the corresponding dates</li>
<li>Integrate my <a href="https://mulberrybeacon.com/">introduction page</a> into the blog as a sort of &ldquo;About Me&rdquo; page.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next steps will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slowly change the current template to increasingly match what I envision to be the future layout for the blog</li>
<li>Create a small prototype with Gatsby to better grasp the learning curve in both bootstrapping a new website with this framework and porting the current layout to React.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and keep writing!</p>
